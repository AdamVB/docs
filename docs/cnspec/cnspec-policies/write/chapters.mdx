A _group_ is a collection of related checks and queries in a policy. Groups are a way of breaking up a policy into more manageable sections.

A common way to use groups is to match the chapters in a written benchmark, policy, or other compliance document. For each chapter in the document, you can create a group in the policy.

Here's another simple example of a policy bundle containing one policy:

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: example-with-chapters
    name: Simple example with chapters
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    groups:
      - title: SSH
        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60
        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params

      - title: Packages
        checks:
          - uid: pkg-01
            title: Ensure AIDE is installed
            mql: package("aide").installed
            impact: 70

          - uid: pkg-02
            title: Ensure prelink is disabled
            mql: package("prelink").installed == false
            impact: 70
```

The policy contains two groups:

- The `SSH` group begins on line 10. It has two checks and one query, all concerning SSH parameters.

- The `Packages` group begins on line 26. It has two checks, both of which concern installed packages.

A policy can have as many groups as you need.
