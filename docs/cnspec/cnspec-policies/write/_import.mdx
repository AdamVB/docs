THIS TOPIC IS NOT VISIBLE TO READERS

Now that you've learned how to [break policies into chapters](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/chapters/), you can learn how to import policies into a policy bundle.

Importing policies is another organizational tactic that can also save time. You can import a policy from a Mondoo policy bundle or from another one of your own policy bundles.

Here's a simple example of a policy bundle containing one policy:

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    mrn: //policies/simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    groups:
      - checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params
```

Notice the `mrn` on line 3. This value allows you to import the policy into other policies or policy bundles.

Here's an example of a policy that imports `Simple example policy 1`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: example-with-chapters
    name: Simple example with chapters
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    groups:
      - type: chapter
        title: SSH
        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60
        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params
            - type: chapter

        type: chapter
        title: Packages
        checks:
          - uid: pkg-01
            title: Ensure AIDE is installed
            mql: package("aide").installed
            impact: 70

          - uid: pkg-02
            title: Ensure prelink is disabled
            mql: package("prelink").installed == false
            impact: 70
```

The policy contains two chapters:

- The `SSH` chapter begins on line 10. It has two checks and one query, all concerning SSH parameters.

- The `Packages`chapter begins on line 28. It has two checks, both of which concern installed packages.

A policy can have as many chapters as you need.
