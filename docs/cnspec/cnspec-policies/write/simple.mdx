Policies are the specifications that cnspec uses when it scans an asset. cnspec compares your asset's configuration against the standards set in policies, and calculates a score based on the comparison.

Mondoo provides dozens of free policy bundles (collections of policies) with cnspec that cover the most common types of assets&mdash;and Mondoo Platform has even more. If your organization has unique needs that these policy bundles don't meet, you can create custom policy bundles.

## A very simple policy bundle

All cnspec policies are stored in YAML files. These files are called bundles because they bundle policies together. Their filename ends in `.mql.yaml`. To learn more about policies and policy bundles, read [About Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/).

Here's a very simple example of a policy bundle. It contains only one policy, `Simple example policy 1`:

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    docs:
      desc: |-
        Descriptive documentation about this policy
    groups:
      - title: group1
        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params
```

We'll use this simple policy bundle example to explore how to write a policy.

## Basic policy attributes

| The attribute... | On line... | Defines...                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uid              | 2          | A unique identifier for the policy                                                                                                                                |
| name             | 3          | A descriptive name for the policy                                                                                                                                 |
| version          | 4          | The current version of the policy.<br />We recommend using semantic versioning to keep track of major and minor policy changes.                                   |
| scoring_system   | 5          | How Mondoo calculates the score for an asset: `average` or `highest impact`. To learn more, read [Score Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/policy-scoring/). |
| authors          | 6-7        | The person or entity to credit for writing the policy, and email where they can be reached.                                                                       |
| docs             | 9-11       | Optional documentation section for describing the policy's purpose and makeup.                                                                                    |

The `groups` section of the policy defines the checks and queries that define how to assess and report on asset security. To learn more, read [Break up a Policy into Groups / Chapters](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/chapters/).

## Queries

A _query_ is an [MQL](/mql/mql.write/) inquiry that requests information about an asset. For example, a query can ask what version of an OS is running on a container or request the UIDs, names, and statuses are of all users in an application.

Queries in a policy add helpful insights to scan report output. (They're also the bases for checks, which are described below.)

The simple example policy bundle above contains one query (on lines 26-28). It requests the configuration values of the SSH server scanned. This information is included in the scan report output.

| The attribute... | On line... | Defines...                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uid              | 26         | A unique identifier for the query                                                                                      |
| title            | 27         | A descriptive name for the query                                                                                       |
| mql              | 28         | The [MQL](/mql/mql.write/) query that requests information, such as the number of root accounts or the state of a port |

To learn how to create MQL queries, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql.write/).

### Checks

An [MQL](/mql/mql.write/) query that also makes an assertion and produces a score is called a _check_. Checks retrieve a value just like any query. For example, a check can ask _What OS version is running?_ How they differ from other queries is that they compare the retrieved value to a _desired_ value and create a score based on that comparison. For example, a check can assert that the value should be 8.3.1 or higher. All checks return a Boolean `true` or `false`. In our example, if the current OS version on the scanned asset is 8.2, the check returns `false`. If the current OS version is 8.3.1 or 8.3.5, the check returns `true`.

Checks are the building blocks of policies. A typical policy identifies a number of desired configurations (such as _MFA is enabled_ and _no ports are publicly accessible_) and instructs Mondoo to compare that to the actual configuration on the scan target. This is a collection of checks.

The simple example policy bundle above contains two checks:

- The check defined in lines 15-18 ensures the SSH port is set to 22.

- The check defined in lines 20-23 ensures that SSH uses a strong cipher.

Each check has its own attributes:

| The attribute... | On lines... | Defines...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| uid              | 15 & 20     | A unique identifier for the check                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| title            | 16 & 21     | A descriptive name for the check that's useful in report output                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| mql              | 17 & 22     | The [MQL](/mql/mql.write/) assertion that identifies the desired condition or configuration, such as logging is enabled or encryption is required                                                                                                            |
| impact           | 18 & 23     | How important (on a scale from 0 to 100) the check is in the scope of the entire policy. The impact and result of each check determine the asset's score on the policy. To learn more, read [Score Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/policy-scoring/). |
