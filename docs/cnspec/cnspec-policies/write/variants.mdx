Variants are checks that behave differently based on conditions you define. They're alternative versions of checks.

For example, suppose you want to ensure that Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is restricted from the internet. You want to perform this check both in GCP projects and in Terraform files. You can do this by creating one variant for GCP projects and another for Terraform files:

- The GCP variant queries if the asset is a GCP project and checks RDP access using the GCP resource.

- The Terraform variant queries if the asset is a Terraform file and checks RDP access using the Terraform resource.

- If the asset is neither a GCP project nor a Terraform file, cnspec doesn't execute an RDP check.

## Filters

cnspec relies on _filters_ to determine which variant to run against an asset. A filter is a condition written in [MQL](/mql/mql.write/). Any fields you can query about any [resources](/mql/resources/) can be the basis for a filter.

To learn more about filters, read [Limit Target Assets with Filters](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/filters/).

## Create variants

To create variants for a check, you define the variants in a `variants` section of the check. This tells cnspec that the check is made up of variants, and what those variants are.

```yml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: okta-security-example-with-variants
    name: Example of a policy that uses variants
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
checks:
  - uid: password-minimum-length
    title: Minimum password length
    impact: 30
    variants:
      - uid: password-minimum-length-runtime
      - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-hcl
      - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-plan
      - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-state
  - uid: password-minimum-length-runtime
    title: Minimum password length - runtime variant
    filters: asset.platform == "okta-org"
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      okta.policies.password.all( settings['password']['complexity']['minLength'] >= 15 )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-hcl
    title: Minimum password length - Terraform HCL variant
    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-hcl" && terraform.providers.one( nameLabel == "okta" )
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      terraform.resources.where( nameLabel == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( arguments['password_min_length'] == /var/ || arguments['password_min_length'] >= 15 )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-plan
    title: Minimum password length - Terraform plan variant
    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-plan" && terraform.plan.resourceChanges.contains( providerName == /okta/ )
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      terraform.plan.resourceChanges.where( type == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( change.after['password_min_length'] >= 15 )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-state
    title: Minimum password length - Terraform state variant
    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-state" && terraform.state.resources.contains( type == /okta_policy_password/ )
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      terraform.state.resources.where( type == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( values['password_min_length'] >= 15 )
```

Lines 13-17 in the `okta-security-example-with-variants` policy establish the variants for the `password-minimum-length` check. These are the four variants:

- Lines 18-23 define the `password-minimum-length-runtime` variant. The filter on line 20 tells cnspec to run this variant only on one condition: The asset is an Okta organization. Line 23 is the check to run if that condition is true.

- Lines 24-29 define the `password-minimum-terraform-hcl` variant. The filter on line 26 tells cnspec to run this variant only on one condition: The asset is an Okta Terraform HCL file. Line 29 is the check to run if that condition is true.

- Lines 30-35 define the `password-minimum-terraform-plan` variant. The filter on line 32 tells cnspec to run this variant only on one condition: The asset is an Okta Terraform plan. Line 35 is the check to run if that condition is true.

- Lines 36-41 define the `password-minimum-terraform-state` variant. The filter on line 38 tells cnspec to run this variant only on one condition: The asset is an Okta Terraform state. Line 41 is the check to run if that condition is true.

## Use one property for multiple variants

Often you use variants to ensure that different types of assets have one common [property](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/properties), as in the example above. All of the variants in the `okta-security-example-with-variants` policy check that the minimum password length is `15`; they just check the value using different resources for different assets.

For efficiency and easier maintenance, you can write all four variants to use one property instead of defining `15` multiple times:

```yml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: okta-security-example-with-variants
    name: Example of a policy that uses variants
    version: "1.0.0"

    title: Minimum password length - runtime variant
    filters: asset.platform == "okta-org"

      okta.policies.password.all( settings['password']['complexity']['minLength'] >= props.minPass )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-hcl

    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-hcl" && terraform.providers.one( nameLabel == "okta" )
    impact: 30

      terraform.resources.where( nameLabel == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( arguments['password_min_length'] == /var/ || arguments['password_min_length'] >= props.minPass )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-plan
    title: Minimum password length - Terraform plan variant
    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-plan" && terraform.plan.resourceChanges.contains( providerName == /okta/ )
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      terraform.plan.resourceChanges.where( type == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( change.after['password_min_length'] >= props.minPass )
  - uid: password-minimum-length-terraform-state
    title: Minimum password length - Terraform state variant
    filters: asset.platform == "terraform-state" && terraform.state.resources.contains( type == /okta_policy_password/ )
    impact: 30
    mql: |
      terraform.state.resources.where( type == /okta_policy_password/ ).all( values['password_min_length'] >= props.minPass )

    title: Minimum password length
    mql: "15"
