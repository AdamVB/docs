Mondoo's [cnspec-policies](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies) GitHub repository is a free source of security, best practices, and compliance policy bundles created by Mondoo and the Mondoo community. You can download any of these policy bundles and use them to scan your assets with cnspec.

The `core` directory contains copies of the policy bundles that cnspec uses by default, so there's no need to download those policies.
