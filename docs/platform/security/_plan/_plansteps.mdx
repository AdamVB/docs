To learn about planning with Mondoo, read [Plan Security Improvement - Overview]. For a detailed example of planning security improvement, read [Example Security Improvement Plan](/platform/security/plan/example/).

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space for which you want to plan security improvements.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Risk Actions**.

4. Use the slider to choose the score you want to achieve now and maintain moving forward. As you move the slider, Mondoo moves checks between the Active list and the Future Goals list.

5. Select the **NEXT STEP** button. The Plan Your Goals step displays.

6. Turn any checks that you want to permanently ignore into exceptions:

   a. Select the checkmark next to each check that you want to ignore.

   b. Select the **MOVE TO** drop-down menu and select **Exceptions**.

7. Create milestones for checks that you want the space to pass in the future:

   a. Select the checkmark next to all the checks that you want to add to a shared milestone.

   b. Select the **MOVE TO** drop-down menu and select **New Milestone**.

   c. Choose a date for the milestone and select the **CREATE MILESTONE** button.

   Repeat steps a through c for more milestones.

8. When you finish creating exceptions and milestones for the space, select the **NEXT STEP** button. The Review Your Plan step displays.

9. Review the milestones you've set. If you need to make changes, go to the bottom of the page and select the **BACK** button. If you're satisfied with the plans you've created, select the **APPLY PLAN** button.

Mondoo recompiles the space's overall score using the new baseline you defined. Each time milestones dates occur, Mondoo recompiles the score again based on the new baseline.
