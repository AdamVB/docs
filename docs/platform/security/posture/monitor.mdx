Mondoo provides continuous security monitoring of the assets in your digital infrastructure. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), you can always see up-to-date scan results for all the assets registered with your account.

The **Inventory** view in the Mondoo Console provides many ways to monitor your infrastructure security, from overall scores for spaces in your organization down to how an individual asset scores on different checks in a policy.

## Access the Inventory view and monitor assets

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the organization containing the space you want to view.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Spaces**.

3. To drill down into a space, select the box representing the space. To drill down into the assets in the space, select the **INVENTORY** box.

4. Filter the list of assets:

   - If there are multiple types of assets in the space, you can select a type to show only assets of that type. For example, select AWS to show only AWS assets. To stop filtering by integration type, select the integration type again.

   - To filter by account, namespace, or configuration keywords, type the word or part of the word in the search box.

   - To remove a filter, select the **x** next to the filter.

5. To see details on an asset's most recent security scan, select the asset.

## How Mondoo scores policies

When Mondoo scans your assets, it produces a graded score to assess risk to your business. Mondoo scoring is based on policies that match the type of asset scanned. For example, there are policies for Windows, Linux, Kubernetes clusters, and so on. You [choose which policies are enabled](/platform/security/posture/policies/) in a space. An asset can match multiple policies enabled in a space.

These are the ranges for Mondoo scores:

```text
score:
    80  ..  100   A (100 A+ 95 A 85 A- 80)
    60  ..   79   B ( 79 B+ 75 B 65 B- 60)
    30  ..   59   C ( 59 C+ 50 C 40 C- 30)
    10  ..   29   D ( 29 D+ 25 D 15 D- 10)
     0  ..    9   F
```
