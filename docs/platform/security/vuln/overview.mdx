A _vulnerability_ is a weakness in a computer system that an attacker can exploit to gain access or extract information. Vulnerabilities have descriptions that may or may not include exploits and methods to address the weakness.

Vendors often release _advisories_ that provide recommendations on how to fix or mitigate vulnerabilities in their products. Mondoo let you know if there are advisories relevant to your infrastructure.
