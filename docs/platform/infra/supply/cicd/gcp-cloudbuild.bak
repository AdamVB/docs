GCP Cloud Build is a Docker-based pipeline where each task executes in its own Docker container. To run a vulnerability scan, we use the Mondoo's docker image and verify the image before its being uploaded to GCR.

```yaml title="cloudbuild.yaml"
# Scan Docker image with Mondoo before pushing to GCR
substitutions:
  _IMAGE_NAME: demo_image
  _MONDOO_AGENT_ACCOUNT: ""
steps:
  # build docker image
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args: ["build", "-t", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/${_IMAGE_NAME}", "."]
  # store docker image in workspace
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "save",
        "-o",
        "/workspace/${_IMAGE_NAME}.tar",
        "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/${_IMAGE_NAME}",
      ]
  # store mondoo credentials into workspace
  - name: "mondoolabs/mondoo"
    entrypoint: /bin/sh
    args:
      [
        "-c",
        "echo ${_MONDOO_AGENT_ACCOUNT} | base64 -d > /workspace/mondoo.json",
      ]
  # run mondoo config
  - name: "mondoolabs/mondoo"
    args:
      [
        "scan",
        "docker",
        "/workspace/${_IMAGE_NAME}.tar",
        "--config",
        "/workspace/mondoo.json",
      ]
    # optional environment variables, those enable you to reference the mondoo report with your build
    env:
      - "CLOUDBUILD=true"
      - "BUILD=$BUILD_ID"
      - "PROJECT=$PROJECT_ID"
      - "COMMIT_SHA=$COMMIT_SHA"
      - "SHORT_SHA=$SHORT_SHA"
      - "REPO_NAME=$REPO_NAME"
      - "BRANCH_NAME=$BRANCH_NAME"
      - "TAG_NAME=$TAG_NAME"
      - "REVISION_ID=$REVISION_ID"
images: ["gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/${_IMAGE_NAME}"]
```

You need to configure a [substitution variable](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values) to store the credentials for Mondoo/cnspec in `_MONDOO_AGENT_ACCOUNT`. You can either [download the credentials](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/registration.md) or use the GCP Cloud Build integration page. For GCP Code Build, you need to encode the [credentials as base64](#store-mondoo-credentials). Next, you create a new `_MONDOO_AGENT_ACCOUNT` variable and paste the content of the agent credentials:

You can see the vulnerability report as part of the CI/CD job.
