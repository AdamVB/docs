You can sign up for Mondoo with your universal login (Google, GitHub, or Microsoft) account or using your email address and a password. After you've signed up, you use that method to log into Mondoo. You can change your login options any time.

## Log in with your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account

You can connect your Mondoo account with a universal login account so that you can use the universal login account to securely access Mondoo. For example, suppose you signed up for Mondoo with an email and password, but you want to log in using your Google account. You simply connect your Google account to your Mondoo account. The next time you log in, you can use Google for authentication.

Connect your universal login with your Mondoo account:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), select your user icon in the top-right corner.

2. Select the **Security** tab.
