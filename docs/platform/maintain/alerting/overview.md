You can configure Mondoo to send an alert whenever there's a change to an asset's security score. These are examples of alert messages:

For Mondoo to send alerts over your messaging platform, you must integrate the messaging platform with your Mondoo space. Mondoo has dedicated support for these platforms:

- [Microsoft Teams](/platform/maintain/alerting/msteams)

- [Slack](/platform/maintain/alerting/slack)

- [Telegram](/platform/maintain/alerting/telegram)

If Mondoo doesn't yet support your messaging platform, you can use the [Mondoo webhook integration](/platform/maintain/alerting/webhook).

For information on receiving email alerts and other Mondoo messages in your inbox, read [Manage Email from Mondoo](/platform/maintain/user/email).
