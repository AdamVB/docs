Mondoo tracks administrative events, such as organization and access management tasks, in audit logs. You access the logs in the Mondoo Console. There are two types of logs:

- For each organization in your account, an _organization log_ tracks member (user) access management.

- For each space in an organization, a _space log_ tracks management tasks, such as creation and deletion of service accounts and agents.

## Access a space audit log

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the organization that contains the space you want to see the log for.

2. Select the space you want to see the log for.
